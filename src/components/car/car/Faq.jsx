							What are the rental rates for your cars?

						<div className="px-4 pb-4">
							<p>
								We charge <strong>20 BDT per kilometer</strong> and <strong>250 BDT per hour</strong> (for the first 4 hours).
								After 4 hours, the hourly rate is reduced to <strong>220 BDT</strong>. A minimum booking duration of 4 hours is required.

							Is a driver included in the car rental?
						</summary>
						<div className="px-4 pb-4">
							<p>
								Yes, all rentals include a professional driver. Self-driving is not currently available for safety and legal reasons in Bangladesh.

							What is the minimum rental duration?
						</summary>
						<div className="px-4 pb-4">
							<p>
								The minimum rental time is <strong>4 hours</strong>. Even if you use the car for less time, the 4-hour minimum charge will apply.

							How do I calculate my total rental cost?
						</summary>
						<div className="px-4 pb-4">
							<p>
								Your cost depends on either the total kilometers or total hours — whichever is higher. For example, if you rent for 4 hours and drive 40 km:
							</p>
							<ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
								<li>4 hours × 250 BDT = 1000 BDT</li>
								<li>40 km × 20 BDT = 800 BDT</li>
							</ul>
							<p className="mt-2">
								You will be charged <strong>1800 BDT</strong> since the hourly rate is higher in this case.

					<details>
						<summary className="py-4 outline-none cursor-pointer focus:underline">
							Do you provide fuel or do I need to pay for it?
						</summary>
						<div className="px-4 pb-4">
							<p>
								Fuel cost is <strong>included</strong> in the per kilometer and per hour rates. You will not need to refuel the car and not to pay for the fuel used during your rental.
